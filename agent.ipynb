      "Summary: Recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs) can assess relevance and support information retrieval (IR) tasks such as document ranking and relevance judgment generation. However, the internal mechanisms by which off-the-shelf LLMs understand and operationalize relevance remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we systematically investigate how different LLM modules contribute to relevance judgment through the lens of mechanistic interpretability. Using activation patching techniques, we analyze the roles of various model components and identify a multi-stage, progressive process in generating either pointwise or pairwise relevance judgment. Specifically, LLMs first extract query and document information in the early layers, then process relevance information according to instructions in the middle layers, and finally utilize specific attention heads in the later layers to generate relevance judgments in the required format.\n",

      "Summary: Given the data-intensive nature of Machine Learning (ML) systems in general, and Large Language Models (LLM) in particular, using them in cloud based environments can become a challenge due to legislation related to privacy and security of data. Taking such aspects into consideration implies porting the LLMs to an on-premise environment, where privacy and security can be controlled. In this paper, we study this porting process of a real-life application using ChatGPT, which runs in a public cloud, to an on-premise environment. The application being ported is AIPA, a system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and sophisticated data analytics to enhance the assessment of procurement call bids. The main considerations in the porting process include transparency of open source models and cost of hardware, which are central design choices of the on-premise environment.\n",

      "Summary: The globalization of social interactions has heightened the need for machine translation (MT) on Social Network Services (SNS), yet traditional models struggle with culturally nuanced content like memes, slang, and pop culture references. While large language models (LLMs) have advanced general-purpose translation, their performance on SNS-specific content remains limited due to insufficient specialized training data and evaluation benchmarks. This paper introduces RedTrans, a 72B LLM tailored for SNS translation, trained on a novel dataset developed through three innovations: (1) Supervised Finetuning with Dual-LLM Back-Translation Sampling, an unsupervised sampling method using LLM-based back-translation to select diverse data for large-scale finetuning; (2) Rewritten Preference Optimization (RePO), an algorithm that identifies and corrects erroneous preference pairs through expert annotation, building reliable preference corpora; and (3) RedTrans-Bench, the first benchmark for SNS translation, evaluating phenomena like humor localization, emoji semantics, and meme adaptation.\n",

In open quantum systems (OQS), such bounds have been principally\\naffected by system environment coupling. In the recent past, drives on OQS have\\nshown to give rise to drive-induced dissipation (DID). In this work, we\\ninvestigate how DID affects the quantum speed limits. To this end, we use a\\nrecently-reported quantum master equation that takes into account environment\\nfluctuations and provide a closed form estimate of drive-induced dissipation.\\nOn such a system, we use Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) to find\\noptimal route to move from an initial state to a desired final state.

The\\nproposed approach employs a hybrid quantum-classical framework, utilizing\\nquantum computing to solve the binary decision component while integrating\\nclassical optimization techniques, including iterative convex relaxation and\\nalternating direction method of multipliers. Results: Computational experiments\\nwere conducted on clinical test cases to evaluate QC-BAO's performance against\\nclinically verified angles and a heuristic approach, GS-BAO.
